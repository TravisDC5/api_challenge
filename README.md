# Observations

* Observing the data, at the equator (0 lattitude), shows the highest temperature values in a condensed cluster, this is because there is      minimal change in distance from the run regardless of which hemisphere is in its summer or winter cycle (think planet tilt); cities closest to the equator generally stay hotter with consistent clear weather climate; while the latitudes in the positive and negative increase will have non consistent temperatures due to there localized climate.
* Being the hottest location at the equator (0 lattitude), the data shows it to have a consistent humidity percentage at the equator; whereas as you move away from the equator its more sporadic which is due to variety of weather patterns and differences between temperatures.
* Clouds and Wind Speed have no real correlation as these can fluctuate more frequently during one day cycle then compared to temperature; coriolis plays a big role along with pressure differentials which can cause an increase or decrease in winds, while cloud travel will be determined by how fast or slow they'll move across the sky depending on the winds, so it is much harder to predict.
